\title{
Plot quality metrics for geographic assignments
}

\description{
Plot the output from \code{QA}, including spatial precision, bias, sensitivity and odds ratio of known locations for validation samples.

}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    One or more QA objects
  }
  \item{...}{
    Other arguments to be passed to plot
  }
  \item{outDir}{
  character string. Directory path to which output will be saved. If NULL no files are written.
